            <h3>Details about BTS</h3>

            <p>(Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan), also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a South Korean boy band that
                was formed in 2010 and debuted in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment.[5] The septet—consisting of members
                Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook—co-writes and co-produces much of their own output.
                Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their
                lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles
                of school-age youth and coming of age, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism.
                Their work also often references literature and psychological concepts and includes an alternative
                universe storyline.</p>
